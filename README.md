# fetal_health_classification_model
Here you will be able to find a KNN machine learning classification model to predict fetal health during pregnancy. 


In this model, cross validation was applied in order to find the optimal amount of N-Neighbours. SMOTE was also used to balance target classes before fitting the model.
